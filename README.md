# Objective
The objective of this project is to gain insights into factors impacting students' mental health and well-being. By analyzing various aspects such as academic pressure, social relationships, and mental health challenges like depression and anxiety, the project aims to uncover patterns and provide actionable insights that can aid in designing wellness programs and interventions for students.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project includes data on students’ demographic details, academic information, and mental health factors. Key features include:

# Demographic Information: 
Gender, age, and residential status
Academic Information: Academic year, degree level, CGPA, and field of study
Mental Health Factors: Levels of depression, anxiety, and feelings of isolation
Lifestyle and Social Interactions: Average sleep hours, sports engagement frequency, and social relationships
Additional Information: Experiences of discrimination or harassment, stress-relief activities, academic pressure, and financial concerns
This dataset provides a holistic view of students' experiences, allowing us to explore connections between academic performance, mental health, and social factors.

# Data Preparation Steps
## Data Cleaning:
Removed duplicates and handled any missing or inconsistent entries.
Standardized categorical values for uniformity (e.g., standardized responses for residence type and academic levels).
## Feature Engineering:
Created binary indicators for factors like depression, anxiety, and isolation based on predefined thresholds.
Extracted key terms from multi-response columns, such as "stress-relief activities," to facilitate easier analysis.
## Data Transformation:
Converted categorical responses into numerical codes where needed for analysis.
Aggregated data by relevant factors such as academic year and degree level to allow meaningful comparisons.
# Analysis Conducted
The analysis aimed to explore the relationships between various factors in students’ mental health and academic life. This includes:

Distribution of students by academic year, gender, and residential status
Trends in CGPA across degree levels
Patterns in depression, anxiety, and other mental health indicators based on demographics and academic stressors
Sleep and sports engagement patterns and their correlation with academic performance and mental health
Insights into discrimination, harassment, and their impact on mental health
Popular stress-relief activities among students facing high levels of anxiety or depression
# Key Questions Addressed
1.What is the distribution of students across different academic years, and how does CGPA vary by degree level?
2.What percentage of students experience depression or anxiety, and how does it impact their sleep and sports engagement?
3. How are academic pressure and poor social relationships linked to mental health challenges?
4. Which fields of study have the highest and lowest average stress levels?

5.What are the most common stress-relief activities among students with high anxiety or depression?
6.How do demographic factors like gender and residential status influence feelings of future insecurity?
